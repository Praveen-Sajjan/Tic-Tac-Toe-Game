# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
We all have played this game in our childhood and we still play it.
It's one of a kind simple game where in 2 players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
